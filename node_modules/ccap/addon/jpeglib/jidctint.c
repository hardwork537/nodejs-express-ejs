 * This file contains a slow-but-accurate integer implementation of the
 * inverse DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform).  In the IJG code, this routine
 * must also perform dequantization of the input coefficients.
 *
 * A 2-D IDCT can be done by 1-D IDCT on each column followed by 1-D IDCT
 * on each row (or vice versa, but it's more convenient to emit a row at
 * a time).  Direct algorithms are also available, but they are much more
 * complex and seem not to be any faster when reduced to code.
 *
 * This implementation is based on an algorithm described in
 *   C. Loeffler, A. Ligtenberg and G. Moschytz, "Practical Fast 1-D DCT
 *   Algorithms with 11 Multiplications", Proc. Int'l. Conf. on Acoustics,
 *   Speech, and Signal Processing 1989 (ICASSP '89
